# Concepts and decisions

This document explains the concepts and choices as their components are introduced.

## Native iOS foundation

**Concept**
The assessment requires a native mobile application. The app interface and shared logic have different responsibilities.

**Decision**
Use Swift and SwiftUI with an iOS 17 minimum deployment target. Keep platform-independent models and delivery logic in a local `CaptureCore` Swift package. Its macOS 14 support allows the existing core tests to run on this Mac. There are no third-party runtime dependencies. iOS-specific camera, lifecycle, and UI integration belong in the app.

## Capture identity and image data

**Concept**
A capture needs one identity throughout saving, sending, and retrying. Loading every saved image just to display a history list would waste memory.

**Decision**
Use a UUID for each capture and preserve it across attempts. `CaptureItem` describes history metadata without image bytes; `UploadPayload` carries the image for delivery. The types distinguish selfies from document photos. Storage and delivery will implement these contracts in subsequent steps.

## Queue states

**Concept**
Saving a photo, attempting delivery, and receiving confirmation are different events. An unsuccessful attempt must not imply the photo was lost.

**Decision**
Define four states: `pending`, `uploading`, `uploaded`, and `failed`. Capture metadata includes attempts, the next eligible attempt time, and an explanatory message. `QueueSummary` provides counts and outstanding image bytes for the interface. The persistence and upload components will implement the transitions later; defining the states alone does not provide recovery.

## Delivery confirmation

**Concept**
A response must identify which capture was accepted and which image bytes it refers to. A retry after a lost response can otherwise create a duplicate.

**Decision**
Represent confirmation with an `UploadReceipt` containing the capture UUID and image digest. The later worker will validate both before marking a capture uploaded, and the mock receiver will deduplicate repeated requests. This step defines the receipt; it does not yet calculate digests or send requests.

## Retry policy

**Concept**
Repeated immediate attempts can overload an unavailable service. Automatic attempts also need a limit so persistent failures remain visible and actionable.

**Decision**
Use the existing policy of five automatic attempts, starting with a two-second retry delay and doubling subsequent delays. The delay function caps at 60 seconds; the five-attempt budget normally uses delays of 2, 4, 8, and 16 seconds. Manual retry will renew the budget when the coordinator is introduced. The existing unit test verifies exponential delay and the cap. Deterministic delays keep this prototype simple; fleet-wide retry jitter is not implemented.
